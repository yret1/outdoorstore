Clothville

A Company that focuses on green products. The only problem, it isn't real!

This is my first larger react-project, Made using FAKESTORE-API, React, css and unsplash.

Clothville is now optimized for most screen sizes and even includes a functional contact form that sends the message straight to me!

This project gave me a lot of new skills and made me use my previously obtained knowledge of Javascript in new ways

Huge thanks to The Odinproject and W3Schools!

Happy 2024!
